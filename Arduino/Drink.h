//  Interface (description of the object) for the Drink object (the finished drink, which is the 
//  sum of all its pours). Includes an array of pour information, and a variable to check whether
//  it's in the process of pouring or not. The functions that open the valves, time their closing
//  and move the cup or carousel will go in this section.
//
//  A Drink has many Pours.  A Pour belongs to a Drink.
